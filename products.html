            <img src="vinylprinter.jpg" alt="Vinyl Printer" width="25%">
            <p>Vinyl t-shirt printing, also known as heat transfer vinyl printing, is a great way to personalize t-shirts and apparel with custom designs. The process, however, is tedious, and the design is not as durable as a screen printing method and is therefore not recommended for bulk orders</p>

            <h2>Screen Printing</h2>
            <img src="screenprinting.jpg" alt="screenprinting Printer" width="25%">
            <p>Screen printing is a printing method that pushes ink through a woven screen onto the fabric. With this method, a unique screen must be made for each design. The colors and elements of the design are applied to the garment layer by layer. The more layers your design has, the longer it'll take to print it and the thicker it will feel. The long setup time is why screen printing is primarily used to print items in bulk. Printing only a t-shirt or two is not cost-effective if it's taken hours to create the stencils and screens for your design.</p>

            <h2>Embroidery</h2>
            <img src="embroidery.jpg" alt="Vinyl Printer" width="25%">
            <p>Embroidery is the art of applying decorative designs onto fabric using a needle. This technique is one of the oldest methods of decoration known to man, and it has been refined and perfected over the years for a wide variety of products. At Screeners Ink, we can apply embroidered designs to shirts, hats, hoodies, and more.</p>
