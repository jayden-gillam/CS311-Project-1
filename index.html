        <h2>Who We Are and What We're About</h2>
        <p>
            Screeners Ink, founded by Jayden Gillam in the Summer of 2022, began its journey as a vinyl print company focused on delivering high-quality, custom vinyl printing solutions to its customers. Over time, as the company's reputation for craftsmanship and attention to detail grew, Screeners Ink seized the opportunity to expand its service offerings. Today, it has evolved into a full-service print and apparel customization company, adding both screen printing press work and embroidery to its growing repertoire.
            The expansion into screen printing has allowed Screeners Ink to accommodate larger orders with intricate designs, offering durable, vibrant prints that are ideal for everything from promotional items and custom apparel to uniforms and branded merchandise. The addition of embroidery services brings another layer of craftsmanship, allowing clients to opt for a textured, sophisticated look with custom-stitched logos, monograms, and designs on a variety of fabrics. Whether for corporate branding, team uniforms, or personalized gifts, embroidery adds a professional touch that further broadens the company's appeal.
            Based in Windfall, IN, a town located about 40 miles north of Indianapolis, Screeners Ink's location offers both small-town charm and accessibility to larger markets. This strategic location allows them to service the central Indiana region, providing local businesses, schools, and organizations with high-quality customized products. However, the company's ambitions extend beyond regional borders. By leveraging its growing online presence and strong customer relationships, Screeners Ink is positioning itself for national growth, aiming to serve clients across the country.
            Whether customers need vinyl printing, screen printing, or custom embroidery, Screeners Ink has established itself as a go-to provider for high-quality, customizable products, with a commitment to delivering excellence in every order.
